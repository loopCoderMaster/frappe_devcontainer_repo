## Development Containers

What are Development Containers?
A development container (or dev container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud, in a variety of supporting tools and editors.

The Development Container Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option – so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing. Beyond the specification's core metadata, the spec also enables developers to quickly share and reuse container setup steps through Features and Templates.

## DevPod
https://devpod.sh/
https://github.com/loft-sh/devpod

DevPod is a client-only tool to create reproducible developer environments based on a devcontainer.json on any backend. Each developer environment runs in a container and is specified through a devcontainer.json. Through DevPod providers, these environments can be created on any backend, such as the local computer, a Kubernetes cluster, any reachable remote machine, or in a VM in the cloud.

### DevPod Providers
https://devpod.sh/docs/managing-providers/add-provider

The DevPod team maintains providers for popular services such as:

- Docker (docker)
- Kubernetes (kubernetes)
- SSH (ssh)
- AWS (aws)
- Google Cloud (gcloud)
- Azure (azure)
- Digital Ocean (digitalocean)
